## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Python test harness (`harness/`), shared by the browser and CI. It has 14 scenarios that both runtimes must match, and a Python CI job (uv, ruff, pytest) on Python 3.14.
- ADR-0010: a local Supabase in Docker for development, and one cloud project for real use.
- A setup guide for the owner's computer and accounts (`docs/setup.md`).
- Web app scaffold in `web/`: Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and React Router, with placeholder Today, Map and Topic pages. The product name is kept in a single setting.
- CI on GitHub Actions: formatting, lint, type-check, tests and build on every pull request and every push to `main`.
- v1 spec, data model and Python Foundations track plan, in `docs/specs/`.
- ADR-0008 (append-only event log) and ADR-0009 (per-topic reviews, graded automatically), both accepted.
- Project documentation: vision, learning-science principles, roadmap, competitor research, devlog.
- Decision records ADR-0001 to ADR-0007: decision process, mastery and gating, AI roles, content model, free hosting, working name, tech stack.
- `CLAUDE.md` with the development process and the product rules that constrain code.
- Repository config: `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (LF line endings), `.editorconfig`.

### Changed

- Data model: the content validator uses the harness's own test runner instead of pytest.
- Process: Claude merges its own pull requests once CI passes, under standing permission from the owner.
- Roadmap: the "prove it" checks, topic states and gating move from Phase 2 into Phase 1.
